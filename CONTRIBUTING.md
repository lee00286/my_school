## How to Begin

Before contributing to an open-source project on GitHub, you'll need to [set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git).

### Fork the Repository

[Forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting any of the original code.

Click **Fork** (in the top-right corner of the page) to copy this repository to your GitHub account.

### Clone the Fork

[Creating a local clone of your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork) lets you save the files in that repository on your computer.

Use `git` to clone the fork. Make sure to replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/my_school
```

## How to Contribute

You are now ready for the contribution! Feel free to make changes in your fork of this project.
